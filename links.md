Stuff I find useful that you might find useful too.

***

## General

* [ML Researcher Twitter List](https://twitter.com/sakishinoda/lists/ml): A collection of researchers and machine learning / deep learning-related companies active on Twitter.
* [Distill](http://distill.pub/): Online-first peer-reviewed journal on machine learning with clear, interactive visualisations and demos. Lots of star power in the steering committee.
* [WildML](http://www.wildml.com): Blog by Denny Britz, a Google Brain resident, on assorted topics in machine learning.

## R

* [RStudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): they have conceptual names but are basically easy reference for the great Hadleyverse packages:
  * [Data Import (PDF)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-import-cheatsheet.pdf), i.e. tidyr (forget reshape and reshape2)
  * [Data Transformation (PDF)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-transformation-cheatsheet.pdf), i.e. dplyr (ddply? plyr? what's that?)
  * [Data Visualization (PDF)](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf), i.e. ggplot2 (nothing comes close to ggplot2, in R or Python)

* Other Hadleyverse packages I love:
  * [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/index.html) for web scraping
  * [readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html) for importing `.xls` and `.xlsx` Excel spreadsheets

* [VisNetwork](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/): A fantastic R library for visualising networks.

* [igraph](http://igraph.org/redirect.html): "The network analysis package" describes it pretty well. Available in Python, R and C.

## Python
* [Using % and .format() for great good!](https://pyformat.info): my go-to source for Python string formatting

## Tensorflow
* [RNNS in Tensorflow: A practical guide and undocumented features](http://www.wildml.com/2016/08/rnns-in-tensorflow-a-practical-guide-and-undocumented-features/)
